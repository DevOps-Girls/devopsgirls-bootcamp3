# DevOpsGirls Bootcamp #3!

![DevOps Girls](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/images/devopsgirls.jpg)

Here is the content for the day, the slides will be posted soon.

## Let's do this!

We will deploy a website the cloud using three different and interesting methods:

1.) [Deploy your site to a server!](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-1-CodeStar-EC2.md)

2.) [Deploy your site to a container (woah!!)](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site.md)

3.) [Deploy a serverless site!!! ](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-3-serverless-static-site.md)

Each of these approaches has a different set of use cases and you will be able to recognize the value that each option provides.

Feel free to talk to any of the coaches, we're more than happy to help to help.

Welcome again to the third DevOps Girls bootcamp and we hope you enjoy it!
