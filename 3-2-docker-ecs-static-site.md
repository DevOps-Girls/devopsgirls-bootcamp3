# Module 2: ECS (CS)

## Learning Objectives

● Learn about Containers technologies and understand their appeal to developers and how 
to deploy, host and scale containers using AWS tools.  
● Use Cloudformation to create the prerequisite resources required by ECS . This includes
creating a Cluster , a Service , Tasks (using Cloudformation)    
● This module will go over creating a Docker container (using resources from S3),
uploading it to a Registry.  
● Modify the pipeline created above, also to deploy the site to the ECR cluster.  
● Recognize the convenience and power of containers & appreciate the benefits of using
this approach.

## Material & Tools Required
● Laptop  
● AWS account  
● Same site files from previous module  

## Deploy a static website using a Docker container on AWS ECS

In this module you will deploy a static website using a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/what-container) on Amazon Elastic Container Service ([Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)). The main aim of this configuration is that you can use it to run Docker applications on a scalable cluster that allows you, for instance, to run the applications easily by eliminating the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure or to scale your containers up or down to meet your application's capacity requirement.

If you are imagining how it could be, it should look like this:

### Introduction to the Dockerfile definition

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using **docker build** users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

*For further information about Dockerfile please visit [this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

In this exercise you will use a *Dockerfile* that it has already the necessaries steps that the container definition needs and also is ready to be use it in the [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template that will create all the infrastructure for you, as the container definition, the task definition, the service and the cluster configuration.

The *Dockerfile* for this exercise looks like this:

```javascript
FROM httpd:alpine

COPY ./index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
```

### Creating the Elastic Container Service (ECS) using a Cloudformation template

As we mention in the previous step, you will create the whole infrastructure using the AWS Cloudformation service, which allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications.  
Also, in the template is included a *Docker container* definition that contain a web server to include an HTML static web page. This web page is going to be the first check point of the exercise, since after that in the next part you will configure a **Codepipeline** to deploy a new release of the web page.

2.0 Right click on the the following [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/master/templates/module2-ecs-static-site.yaml) and save the *module2-ecs-static-site.yaml*  in your local machine / computer / laptop.

2.1 Login with your credential to the **same** AWS account you have used in the Module 1:

2.1.1 Open a web browser and go to https://xxxxxx.signin.aws.amazon.com/console. Log in using your supplied account credentials.  

2.1.2 Ensure you are in the right AWS region. On the top-right side, make sure you select **(Asia Pacific (Sydney))**. Once you have successfully logged in, under the AWS services search field, search for *Cloudformation* and click on the **Cloudformation** auto drop down element.

2.2 In the screen's upper left corner click on the blue button **'Create Stack'**.

![3-2-2-2-create-cf-stack](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-2-create-cf-stack.png?raw=true)

2.3 In the **Select Template** page, under the section *Choose a template* click "Browse.." to choose **yaml** template downloaded before (*module2-ecs-static-site.yaml*), and click "next" 

![3-2-2-3-select-template](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-3-select-template.png?raw=true)

2.4 Under the **Specify Details** page, in the *Stack name* field enter your *first name, last name* **without a space** following the **-cf-ecs** string, as well as the name of the **StackParentStack** that in this case must be *DevOpsGirlsVPC* as shown in the image below.  
Leave the rest of the information with the default values.  

![3-2-2-4-specify-datails](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-4-specify-datails.png?raw=true)

2.5 In the **Options** page specify the following tags:

![3-2-2-5-options-page](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-5-options-page.png?raw=true)

|Key|Value|
|---|---|
|Creator|*your first and last name*|
|Module|2|
|Workshop|DevopsGirls|
|Resource|ECS Cloudformation|

Once you have completed the *tags section*, leave remain information with the default values and click next.

2.6 In the **Review** page check out if everything is good according with the instructions, in the case that you need to modify something click in the **previous** button, or if everything is as you are expecting click in the **create** button to create the *ECS cluster* using a *Cloudformation template*.  
Another important step is at the end of the page you must to **check** the box about *"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources."*
 

![3-2-2-6-review.png](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-6-review.png?raw=true)

2.7 The Stack creation steps is going to take about *5 - 9* minutes (or a little bit more depending the case). 

![3-2-2-8-Creating_Stack](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-8-Creating_Stack.png?raw=true)


2.8 Once it has been created and ready, you have to see something like this:

![3-2-2-9-Stack_Created](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-9-Stack_Created.png?raw=true)

2.9 Another important step when the stack is ready is to check the resources or elements that it has created. To do that, go to the **Resources** tab and you will be able to know all about the resources that have been created using the **Cloudformation template** in the new **Stack**

![3-2-2-10-Resources_Created](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-10-Resources_Created.png?raw=true)


2.10 Another way to do that (and maybe a more user-friendly way) is to check the template in the **designer** application and it will show you a diagram with all the resources that have been created. To do it, check the **Stack Name** box that you want to review, and in the **Actions button** choose the *View/Edit template in Designer*:


![3-2-2-10-b-Resources_Created](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-10-b-Resources_Created.png?raw=true)


2.11 In the **Designer** page you can check out the *Cloudformation template* definition as well as the diagram that shows you the elements that have been created using the *module2-ecs-static-site.yaml* template.


![3-2-2-10-c-Resources_Created](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-10-c-Resources_Created.png?raw=true)

In this case, the diagram looks like this:

![3-2-2-10-c-Resources_Created](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-10-cf-template-diagram.png?raw=true)

2.12 Now is time to check out the ECS that has being created in the stack using the Cloudformation's template. To do that, under the AWS services search field, search for *Elastic Container Service* and click on the *Elastic Container Service* auto drop down element.

![3-2-2-11-a-Searching_ECS_Cluster](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-11-a-Searching_ECS_Cluster.png?raw=true)


2.13 In the **Cluster** page your will be able to see your cluster that contain the name of the stack following a random sequence number

![3-2-2-11-ECS_Cluster](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-11-ECS_Cluster.png?raw=true)

2.14 Click on the *Cluster name* and you will be redirect to the cluster details configuration page. Here you can see information, for instance, about the number of the containers configured in the cluster, as well as the status of cluster, service and task(s).   
(A **service** allows you to run and maintain tasks (containers) in a cluster.)

![3-2-2-11-ECS_Service](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-11-ECS_Service.png?raw=true)

2.15 Click on your *Service Name* and the **Service** page will show up. Here you can see more information about the service configuration.  
In this moment, your aim is to find the place where you can get the IP or URL of the container that contain the web server, which, in turn, contain the static web page.

![3-2-2-11-ECS_Service_Task](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-11-ECS_Service_Task.png?raw=true)

2.16 Under the **Tasks** tab, click on the task that is associated to your service in the **Task** column.   
Now you are almost there ;)!, remember you are looking for the web server information that is configured in a container, so in the bottom of the page you will find a container called **simple-app** and it will give you the information that you are looking for. 

![3-2-2-11-ECS_Service_Task_Container](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-11-ECS_Service_Task_Container.png?raw=true)

2.17 In the **Task** page, under the **Container** section click over the **simple-app**, you will see all the details about the container also the one that you are looking for that correspond to the value providing in the **External Link** information.

![3-2-2-12-ECS_Task_Container_info](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-12-ECS_Task_Container_info.png?raw=true)


2.18 Click on the **External Link** information and congratulation! :) you will see the static web page that you have built using the Cloudformation.

![3-2-2-13-Container_web](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-2-13-Container_web.png?raw=true)

### Creating the AWS CodePipeline, Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery service.

Now is time to create the AWS CodePipleline that is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. You can use CodePipeline to fully model and automate your software release processes.

2.2.0 Download from the [DevopsGirls' public S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/devopsgirls1) the following files:

![3-2-3-0-Update-CodeCommit-Repository](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-0-Update-CodeCommit-Repository.PNG?raw=true)

And push them in your **CodeCommit repository** that you have created in the [Module 1](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-1-CodeStar-EC2.md) in the root level, for instance, if your **CodeCommit repository** name is **JudeMilhon_Repo** save the files in home (root) directory of your **CodeCommit repository** on your workstation and not inside other directory. For further information about how to do it follow the steps described in the section [5. Push changes to CodeCommit Repo](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-1-CodeStar-EC2.md#5-push-changes-to-codecommit-repo)

2.2.1  Under the AWS services search field, search for codestar, and click on the **CodePipeline** auto drop down element

2.2.2 Click on the **Create Pipeline** button. In the **Step 1:Name** in the **Pipeline name** field, provide the name following the structure as *your First Name*, *Your Last Name* following *-Pipeline* string.

![3-2-3-2-CodePipeline_Creation.png](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-2-CodePipeline_Creation.png?raw=true)

2.2.3 In the **Step 2:Source**, under the **Source Provider** choose *AWS CodeCommit* and in the **Repository** field provide the repository that you have used in the [Module 1](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/3-1-CodeStar-EC2.md) (keep in mind that for documentation purpose we are using in the screenshot a different one) and leave the remain information with the default values.

![3-2-3-3-CodePipeline_Creation_Source](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-3-CodePipeline_Creation_Source.png?raw=true)

2.2.4 Under the **Step 3: Build** choose *AWS CodeBuild* as a **Build provider** and in the **Configure your project** section choose *Create a new build project* providing the following the structure as *your First Name*, *Your Last Name* following *-CodeBuild* string.  
The next data that you need to provide on the section **Environment: How to build** is the one that appears in the screenshot. Also, in the **AWS CodeBuild service role** section you have to choose the role created in the stack with the Cloudformation template (you can double check it in the point **2.9** and is the value that appears in the column **Logical ID** *Module2CodeBuildRole*).  
In the next section **VPC**, you have to specified the VPC, the private subnets asociated in the cloudformation creation also the *Security group* (if you have any doubt about how to get those information double check it whit the facilitator's team)
Finally in the **Advanced** section, you have to create four *Environment variables*:

|Name|Value|Type|
|---|---|---|
|IMAGE_REPO_NAME|*The name of your ECR (ECS repository)*|Plaintext|
|IMAGE_TAG|*latest*|Plaintext|
|AWS_ACCOUNT_ID|*The IdNumber associated to your account*|Plaintext|
|AWS_DEFAULT_REGION|*The region where you are working on*|Plaintext|

Once you have provided the above information you can click on **Save build project** button and click **Next**.

2.2.5 In the **Step 4: Deploy** page provide the information acording your *ECS* Cluster configuration and the **Image file name** must be *imagedefinitions.json*

![3-2-3-5-CodePipeline_Creation_Deploy](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-5-CodePipeline_Creation_Deploy.png?raw=true)

2.2.6 Under the final configuration step **AWS Service Role** in the *Role name* fied you have to provide the one that was created in the stack with the Cloudformation template (you can double check it in the point **2.2.9** and is the value that appears in the column **Logical ID** *Module2CodePipelineRole*)

![3-2-3-6-CodePipeline_Creation_ServiceRole](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-6-CodePipeline_Creation_ServiceRole.png?raw=true)

2.2.7 Now is the turn to double check your configuration and if everything looks as expected click on the **Create pipeline** button.

![3-2-3-7-CodePipeline_Creation_Review](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-7-CodePipeline_Creation_Review.png?raw=true)


2.2.8 Now you will see the CodePipeline that you have just created and is going to deploy a new release of the **simple-app** Docker container that contain the web server with the static web page. 


![3-2-3-8-a-CodePipeline_Running](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-8-a-CodePipeline_Running.png?raw=true)

You just need to wait for the process to be completed (it could take about 10 min) and once is ready, check again the IP of your web server and a new web page should be deployed ;).

![3-2-3-8-b-CodePipeline_Completed](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-8-b-CodePipeline_Completed.png?raw=true)

And CONGRATULATIONS again, you have deployed a new release using AWS CodePipeline

![3-2-3-8-b-CodePipeline_Completed](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp3/blob/master/images/3-2-docker-ecs-static-site/3-2-3-8-c-CodePipeline_NewDepoyment.png?raw=true)
