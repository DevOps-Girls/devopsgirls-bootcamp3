## Devopsgirls

We advertise all the upcoming activities through these two channels:

 * Twitter [@devopsgirls](https://twitter.com/devopsgirls)
 * The devopsgirls slack chat. If you want to join DM the above twitter or email devopsgirls (at) rea-group.com. Apart from advertising activities this is agreat medium to chat with the community, ask and respond questions about devops as well as to get access to job offers in the #jobs channel.
 
We have a few activities that we are aiming to run semi-regularly, including:

 * [Weekend DevOps Workshops for Women](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Workshops-for-Women/)
 * Train with us! (Community seats in REA Group internal training)
 * Bootcamps (We have done 3 so far but hoping to keep them happening at least twice a year)

## Women in Devops meetup

The [Women of DevOps meetups](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsWomen/) aim to create a welcoming and engaging environment for women and their allies to discuss all things DevOps.

## Certification

Going through a certification exam is not only a good way to show your expertise to potential employers but also a good way of commiting to learning a topic in depth. 

 * AWS has a wide range of certifications [https://aws.amazon.com/certification/](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
 * If you want to show proficiency in Linux this used to be a really fun certification exam (all hands on and with no single answer to the exercises): [https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification)
